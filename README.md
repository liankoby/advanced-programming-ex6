# Advanced Programming Project ‚Äì Exercise 6

## üìò Project Background

This project was developed as part of the Advanced Programming course at Bar-Ilan University (Spring 2024).  
It implements a **Publisher/Subscriber system visualizer**, allowing users to define and interact with computational graphs.

The system includes:
- A custom HTTP server written in Java
- Uploading configuration files that describe topics and agents
- Dynamic graph rendering based on configuration
- Real-time topic value updates through a browser interface

The goal is to give users a visual and interactive way to explore message propagation in reactive systems.
